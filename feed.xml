                <p>Submission deadline for presentation videos: <strong>November 27, 2020</strong></p>
<p class="p1">To ensure smooth operation for our online program, talks are pre-recorded and uploaded to be streamed during each session. Authors must attend their respective Zoom sessions for the Q&amp;A immediately following the broadcast of their video, according to the moderation of the session chair.</p>
<p>The presentation time is <strong>10 minutes</strong> for research and industry track papers. Videos which significantly exceed this time limit can be cut off by the moderators during the presentation. The files have to be uploaded to YouTube and the video quality has to be at least HD (720p).</p>
<p>Following every presentation, there is a <strong>Q&amp;A session of 5 minutes</strong> which the author is required to attend. At the end of the session, there is a panel discussion comprising all presenters of the session. </p>
<p class="p1">Authors should treat the video recording as a direct substitute for a physical presentation. The audio should contain a spoken narration of the presentation. The accompanying video should contain a full walkthrough of the presentation slides, which are clearly visible. In addition, the presenter is strongly encouraged to overlay a thumbnail-sized camera feed showing the speaker. In addition, please add some 2-3 discussion points to your conclusion slide. As the talks are intentionally kept short for the online format, it is likely that there are points not discussed during the presentation, such as technical details or future work. Please include these in the conclusion slide to facilitate questions during the Q&amp;A.</p>

<div class="">Middleware 2020 will provide a forum for live software demonstrations of middleware applications, systems, and tools. Demos could take a wide and open-ended variety of forms. Typical examples include: (i) presentation of an application that leverages advanced middleware concepts, (ii) working through coding of an example on a novel middleware platform, or (iii) real-time visualizations of middleware system metrics under simulated workloads. Although the form may vary, demo presenters should take advantage of not being constrained by the format of a traditional slide presentation. Demos are encouraged for both early prototypes and mature technology.</div>
<div class=""> </div>
<div class="">Posters will provide an opportunity for conference attendees to learn about innovative work in progress and to preview late-breaking research results. Poster sessions will provide an informal setting for presenters to communicate ideas or results and also to collect feedback from attendees.</div>
<p align="left">Demo or poster contributions are solicited in all areas of middleware research and applications. For a list of applicable topics, please consider those from the call for papers.</p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The annual ACM/IFIP Middleware conference is a major forum for the discussion of innovations and recent advances in the design, construction, and use of middleware systems. Middleware is the software that resides between applications and the underlying architecture and platforms, often with an emphasis on networked computing. The goal of middleware is to facilitate the development of applications by providing higher-level abstractions for better programmability, performance, scalability, and security. It is a rapidly evolving and growing field.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Middleware conference traditionally includes a number of high-quality workshops and tutorials. We invite experts on related research subjects to submit one-day or half-day workshop and/or tutorial proposals within the scope of Middleware 2020. Proposed workshops and tutorials can be on any topic related to middleware, but we are particularly interested in workshops and tutorials focusing on emerging middleware areas.</span></p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1e58t4t903"> </h2>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e58t1bk50"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Workshop proposal submission</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each workshop proposal, not exceeding three pages of 11pt single-spaced text, in PDF format, should include the following information:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the title of the workshop;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the names, affiliations and e-mail addresses of the organizing committee;  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a brief technical description of the workshop topic area; </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the history of the workshop, if applicable;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a short description of the intended format of the workshop (keynote speakers, discussions, etc.); </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a description of the intended review process;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tentative workshop paper submission and notification deadlines (Note that the latest camera-ready hard deadline for all workshop papers is October 16, 2020.);</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a preliminary list of PC members that have accepted to participate in the committee.</span></li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each workshop will organize its own submissions and reviewing procedures and will provide its own website. A link will be provided to the workshop’s website from the Middleware 2020 website. Workshop organizers will ensure that all accepted papers are peer reviewed and will need to upload camera ready and copyright agreements of all accepted papers in a timely manner through the ACM portal. Organizers will plan their workshop’s schedule so that: (i) the paper submission deadline falls after the main conference's notification date; (ii) authors are notified no later than September 28, 2020; and (iii) authors submit their camera-ready papers no later than October 16, 2020. Accepted papers should be no longer than 6 pages in the standard ACM format. <strong>Note that at least one author on each accepted workshop paper must hold a full pre-conference registration, as must at least one workshop organiser.</strong> Workshop organizers are responsible for preparing the papers for their workshops in the format required by ACM. As in previous years, the Middleware conference organizers will provide companion proceedings including all workshop papers, which will be available in the ACM Digital Library. <strong>This is subject to the availability of their camera-ready papers by October 16, 2020.</strong></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Middleware requires workshop organizers to use HotCRP (</span><a href="https://hotcrp.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://hotcrp.com/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) to collect submissions, manage reviewing, and facilitate collection of material for the proceedings.

            <![CDATA[
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The annual ACM/IFIP Middleware conference will include a doctoral symposium, to which all PhD students working on the topics of the Middleware conference are invited to apply. The doctoral symposium will be held on </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuesday, December 8th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, prior to the main conference. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Middleware doctoral symposium is a welcoming and supportive environment allowing all PhD students to receive feedback, discuss their work, and prepare to get the most out of their participation in the main conference. All participating students will be offered the opportunity to engage with their peers, as well as with senior academic and industrial members of the Middleware community. This will include the feedback of panel members on the day of the symposium and individual meetings with a personal mentor during the conference. The symposium is open to PhD students at any stage of their studies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Applicants will be divided into two groups: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Planners: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">students at an early-stage of their thesis who are focused on crafting their research proposal and completing background research. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br><br></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Finishers:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> students closer to finishing their thesis or dissertation and thinking about how to present their research, its results, and its impact. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All PhD students carrying out research on middleware topics are invited to submit a position paper to the doctoral symposium. Papers will be peer-reviewed by the symposium’s committee of selected mentors. The criteria for accepting papers includes the extent of the contribution of the work to the field, the originality of the problem, and the overall quality of the position paper. Position papers should fit within the research topics of the Middleware 2020 main conference. </span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e2vut64p0"><strong>Submission Guidelines</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Position papers are limited to 2 pages (for students in the planner category) or 4 pages (for students in the Finishers category). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Submissions must use the same format as for the research papers. The suggested format is detailed on the Middleware 2020 website. Please see the submission format for the research track. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The submissions should include an author name and associated affiliation: the only author should be the PhD student (other contributors, e.g., the PhD student’s advisor(s), can be acknowledged in a separate section at the end). </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contributions to the Middleware 2020 PhD Workshop will appear in a proceedings that supplements the main conference proceedings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accepted position paper will lead to a presentation during the doctoral symposium and also  require a poster presentation during the main conference. </span></p>

            <![CDATA[
                <p>All trains and most local public transport in the Netherlands have a unified fare and payment system that uses a contactless prepaid card called <em>OV Chipkaart</em>.  While it is possible to purchase one-way disposable tickets at vending stations and, in some forms of transportation, from the driver, you will be charged a surcharge of 1 € per ticket.</p>
<p>If you plan to make multiple rides, it might be advisable to purchase an (anonymous) OV Chipkaart from one of the vending points (ticket machines in every rail station, ticket offices in some larger stations, customer service points in some shops) for 7.50€. This card can be charged with funds and used with the contactless readers in any railway station, in buses, trains, trams, and even some ferries. </p>
<p>When checking in, a lump sum is charged to your card depending on the mode of transportation. At the end of your journey, you need to check out again and then the difference between the lump sum and the effective fare is changed back to your card. For trains, you need a minimum balance of 20€ on your card to check in. For most local public transport around Delft, the lump sum is 4€. There is a <a href="https://www.ov-chipkaart.nl/ov-chip-and-use/use/ov-chipkaart-app.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mobile app</a> through which you can monitor your balance, access your travel history, and apply for a refund in case you forgot to check out at the end of your trip.  </p>
