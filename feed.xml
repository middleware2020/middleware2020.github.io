            <![CDATA[
                <p>All trains and most local public transport in the Netherlands have a unified fare and payment system that uses a contactless prepaid card called <em>OV Chipkaart</em>.  While it is possible to purchase one-way disposable tickets at vending stations and, in some forms of transportation, from the driver, you will be charged a surcharge of 1 € per ticket.</p>
<p>If you plan to make multiple rides, it might be advisable to purchase an (anonymous) OV Chipkaart from one of the vending points (ticket machines in every rail station, ticket offices in some larger stations, customer service points in some shops) for 7.50€. This card can be charged with funds and used with the contactless readers in any railway station, in buses, trains, trams, and even some ferries. </p>
<p>When checking in, a lump sum is charged to your card depending on the mode of transportation. At the end of your journey, you need to check out again and then the difference between the lump sum and the effective fare is changed back to your card. For trains, you need a minimum balance of 20€ on your card to check in. For most local public transport around Delft, the lump sum is 4€. There is a <a href="https://www.ov-chipkaart.nl/ov-chip-and-use/use/ov-chipkaart-app.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mobile app</a> through which you can monitor your balance, access your travel history, and apply for a refund in case you forgot to check out at the end of your trip.  </p>

                <p id="mcetoc_1drk885rb0">Delft is located in the province of South Holland, between the cities of The Hague and Rotterdam, and can be easily reached through different modes of transportation. </p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1drk8h5751">By Airplane</h2>
<h6 id="mcetoc_1drk9ici40">AMS</h6>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam_Airport_Schiphol" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amsterdam Schiphol</a> is one of the largest airports in the world by passenger volume and just ~40 min away from Delft. It is the hub and main base of KLM (direct connections from 50+ locations in Europe and from 50+ in the rest of the world), the European hub for Delta Airlines (direct flights from 10 airports in the USA), hub for the budget airline EasyJet (direct flights from 30+ destinations in Europe), and hub for low-cost carrier Transavia (direct flights from 20+ destinations). </p>
<p><img class="post__image--center" src="https://middleware2020.github.io/media/posts/10/airport-2322977.jpg" width="500" height="375"></p>
<p>There is a train station in the central terminal building with direct train connections to Delft running every 30 minutes, currently departing at :13 and :43 from platform 5 or 6. The travel time to Delft is 38 minutes and the fare is 10.50€ with <a href="https://middleware2020.github.io/ov-chipkaart.html">OV Chipkaart</a> or online ticket and 11.50€ for a disposable ticket. There is an additional connection with a transfer in Leiden on the same platform that also operates twice per hour at :27 and :57.  The service pattern can differ in case of maintenance work or other disruptions, especially on Sundays. In order to plan your trip and get realtime updates, use the travel planner <a href="https://9292.nl" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">9292.nl</a> or the app of the national railway company NS <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en/travel-information/ns-on-your-mobile/ns-app.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">www.ns.nl</a>.</p>
<h6 id="mcetoc_1drk9io871">RTM</h6>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotterdam_The_Hague_Airport" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rotterdam The Hague Airport</a> is a local airport in the municipality of Rotterdam with a limited number direct international connections including London City, Vienna, Lisbon, and Barcelona. </p>
<p>The airport is served by the bus line 37 that operates on an irregular service pattern centered around the main plane arrival times and reaches Delft central station in 20 minutes. The bus line 33 connects to Rotterdam central station and the Metro Line E. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1drka27rr2">By Train</h2>
<p>The new underground <em>Delft Station</em> is the central train station in Delft and located in close proximity to the historic old town and the TU Campus. Both inter-regional trains (InterCity) and local trains (Sprinter) connect Delft with the main traffic hubs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rotterdam: 10 minutes travel time, up to 10 trains per hour, connections from/to <a href="https://www.nsinternational.nl/en/trains/thalys" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thalys</a> (France and Belgium), <a href="https://www.nsinternational.nl/en/trains/eurostar">Eurostar </a>(England and Belgium), and <a href="https://www.nsinternational.nl/en/trains/intercity-brussels" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Intercity Brussels </a>(Belgium)</li>
<li>Amsterdam Central Station: 45 minutes travel time, direct trains every 30 minutes,  connections from/to <a href="https://www.nsinternational.nl/en/trains/ice-international" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ICE International</a> (Germany, Switzerland), <a href="https://www.nsinternational.nl/en/trains/intercity-berlin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Intercity Berlin</a> (Germany), and (from Dec. 2020) <a href="https://www.nsinternational.nl/en/trains/nighttrain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ÖBB Nightjet</a> (Germany, Austria)</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="post__image--center" src="https://middleware2020.github.io/media/posts/10/train-2954371_1920.jpg" width="500" height="333"></p>
<p>In addition, there are direct connections to national traffic hubs:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Hague Central Station, 10 minutes travel time, direct trains every 20 minutes. </li>
<li>Breda, 36 minutes travel time, direct trains every 30 minutes</li>
<li>Eindhoven, 1:15h travel time, direct trains every 30 minutes </li>
</ul>
<p>Most major railway stations in the Netherlands, including Delft, are equipped with fare gates. If you travel with an international ticket, you should have a QR code printed on it which needs to be scanned to exit the station. Note that most gates are only equipped with readers for the contactless <a href="https://middleware2020.github.io/ov-chipkaart.html">OV Chipkaart</a> so you need to locate one of the gates which has a barcode scanner (behind a round glass surface, as shown below), such as the wider gates for people traveling with luggage. </p>
<p><img class="post__image--center" src="https://middleware2020.github.io/media/posts/10/fare_gate.jpg" width="400" height="243"></p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1drkbb0o73">By Car</h2>
<p>Delft is connected to the highways A13 and A4. Parking on the campus is free (as of now). Street parking in the city center is very limited and daily rates start at 12€. Parking garages charge at least 3€ per hour.  </p>
<p>When driving in the city, be mindful of bicycles which often have the right of way at intersections. </p>

<p><img class="post__image" src="https://middleware2020.github.io/media/posts/8/AulaNew.jpg" alt="TU Delft Aula" width="2000" height="830"> </p>
<p>Middleware 2020 will be held in the <a href="https://iamap.tudelft.nl/en/poi/aula-conference-center" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aula Conference Center</a>, located in the heart of the <a href="http://www.tudelft.nl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TU Delft</a> campus. It offers a variety of different meeting rooms, an auditorium, various facilities, and large exhibition areas. A bar and a buffet restaurant are located on the ground floor. All rooms of the TU Delft Conference Centre are equipped with necessary technology (screen, computer, connectors). Eduroam and conference wifi is available. The building is fully accessible.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dq48u2ef0">Visitor Address</h2>
<p id="mcetoc_1dq48vc9i1">TU Delft Aula Conference Centre (Building 20)<br>Mekelweg 5<br>2628 CC Delft<br>The Netherlands</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dq4am6sp1">Bicyling</h2>
<p>The bicycle is the traditional mode of transportation in the Netherlands. Delft has an extensive network of bike lanes, including some dedicated roads for bicycles. Most public places have a large number of bike racks for parking. Be mindful that bike lanes and cycle paths can be very busy during the peak hours and you should be reasonably experienced when cycling in dense traffic. Information about the most important traffic rules for bicycles can be found on <a href="https://www.holland.com/global/tourism/information/general/cycling-rules-in-holland.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">www.holland.com</a>.</p>
<p>Bikes can be rented from various places in the city. The orange bikes from Mobike can be unlocked and used through their <a href="https://mobike.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">mobile app</a></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dq4aloo00">Public Transport</h2>
<p>The Aula Conference Center can easily be reached with public transport. The bus stop <em>TU Aula</em> is in close proximity to the building. At this moment, it is served by the bus lines 40 and 69 which both depart from the central station. Due to construction work on a new bridge, the buses currently take a detour and take about 20 minutes to reach the TU Campus. From mid 2020, they should run the normal route again and the travel time is reduced to 5 minutes. From end of 2020, the bus line 69 will be replaced by the extended Tram line 19. Line 174 also served the stop and connects with the Metro Line E in Pijnacker Zuid. </p>
<h5 id="mcetoc_1drk661tv0">Plan your Trip</h5>
<p>In order to plan your trip, you can use the travel planner <a href="https://9292.nl" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">9292.nl</a> or the app of the national railway company NS which also contains local public transport information <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en/travel-information/ns-on-your-mobile/ns-app.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">www.ns.nl</a></p>
<h5 id="mcetoc_1drk66bom1">Pay your Fare</h5>
<p>While it is possible to use one-way disposable tickets at vending stations and, in some forms of transportation, from the driver, you will be charged a surcharge of 1 € per ticket. Consider purchasing an <a href="https://middleware2020.github.io/ov-chipkaart.html">OV Chipkaart</a>. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dq48iquf0">Campus </h2>
<p><img class="post__image--center" src="https://middleware2020.github.io/media/posts/8/campus.jpg" alt="TU Delft Campus" width="728" height="409"> </p>
<p>TU Delft's campus is one of the largest in the world and spans 161 hectars. It features the faculty buildings as well as common spaces like the sport facilities <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/x/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Delft X</a> and the mixed educational building Pulse. The west side of the campus with the Aula building is directly adjacent to the old town of Delft. A map of the entire campus can be found <a href="https://iamap.tudelft.nl/en/accessibility-and-parking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="align-left">About 27.000 people travel across our campus every day: students, scientist, visitors, and employees of the university and the companies on campus. Stretching over 161 hectares, the campus is larger than downtown Delft, and one of the largest university campuses in the world. The campus has been equipped with an extensive bicycle and pedestrian road network. The TU Delft campus has a green, parky character. Large parts of the campus are therefore only accessible on foot, by bike or public transport. For motorists there is the campus ring road, which circles the entire campus. Clear signage on the campus ring guides you easily to the central parking lots. From there, every destination is reachable on foot. </p>

<p align="left">The annual ACM/IFIP Middleware conference is a major forum for the discussion of innovations and recent advances in the design, construction and use of middleware systems. The Industrial Track of the Middleware 2020 Conference solicits 6-page papers for presentation during the main conference (single track) and inclusion in the ACM Digital Library. The topics of interest are similar to those in the general conference call for papers. However, the purpose of the Industrial Track is to emphasize the practical issues, observations, and measurements of “real-world” systems and applications and to disseminate information of particular interest to middleware researchers, architects, developers and administrators.</p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1dq414lmf2" class="section-title mr-btm-10">Submission Guidelines</h2>
<p align="left">A submission must be a single PDF file conforming to the ACM SIGPLAN Conference Format and must not exceed <strong>6 pages</strong> (including abstract, figures, tables, and appendices, but excluding references). Submissions that do not adhere to these guidelines or that violate formatting will be declined without review. Reviewing is <strong>single-blind</strong>; papers must include author names and affiliations. A sample Latex template using the correct ACM SIGPLAN style can be found <a href="http://2019.middleware-conference.org/middleware18-sample_latex.zip">here</a>. Authors are required to add “(industry track)” at the end of their paper title.</p>
<br>
<p align="left">Each submission will be reviewed by at least three members of the Industrial Track Program Committee. Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of originality, importance of contribution, technical soundness, evaluation, quality of presentation and appropriate comparison to related work. The committee as a whole will make final decisions about which submissions to accept for presentation at the conference.</p>
<br>
<p align="left">Simultaneous submission of the same work to multiple venues, submission of previously published work, or plagiarism constitutes dishonesty or fraud. The conference organizers, like those of other scientific conferences and journals, prohibit these practices and may take actions against authors who have committed them. Papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms will not be considered. If you are uncertain whether your submission meets the guidelines, please contact the program co-chairs.</p>
<br>
<p align="left">By submitting a paper, you agree that at least one of the authors will attend the conference and present the paper in person.</p>
<br>
<p align="left">Submissions will be handled through HotCRP. Please submit papers to HotCRP. </p>
