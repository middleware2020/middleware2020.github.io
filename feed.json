Middleware is the software that resides between applications and the underlying architecture and platforms, often with an emphasis on networked computing.

It is a rapidly evolving and growing field.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Middleware conference traditionally includes a number of high-quality workshops and tutorials.

Delft has an extensive network of bike lanes, including some dedicated roads for bicycles. Most public places have a large number of bike racks for parking. Be mindful that bike lanes and cycle paths can be very busy during the peak hours and you should be reasonably experienced when cycling in dense traffic. Information about the most important traffic rules for bicycles can be found on <a href=\"https://www.holland.com/global/tourism/information/general/cycling-rules-in-holland.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">www.holland.com</a>.</p>\n<p>Bikes can be rented from various places in the city.

The bus stop <em>TU Aula</em> is in close proximity to the building. At this moment, it is served by the bus lines 40 and 69 which both depart from the central station. Due to construction work on a new bridge, the buses currently take a detour and take about 20 minutes to reach the TU Campus. From mid 2020, they should run the normal route again and the travel time is reduced to 5 minutes. From end of 2020, the bus line 69 will be replaced by the extended Tram line 19. Line 174 also served the stop and connects with the Metro Line E in Pijnacker Zuid. </p>\n<h5 id=\"mcetoc_1drk661tv0\">Plan your Trip</h5>\n<p>In order to plan your trip, you can use the travel planner <a href=\"https://9292.nl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">9292.nl</a> or the app of the national railway company NS which also contains local public transport information <a href=\"https://www.ns.nl/en/travel-information/ns-on-your-mobile/ns-app.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">www.ns.nl</a></p>\n<h5 id=\"mcetoc_1drk66bom1\">Pay your Fare</h5>\n<p>While it is possible to use one-way disposable tickets at vending stations and, in some forms of transportation, from the driver, you will be charged a surcharge of 1 € per ticket. Consider purchasing an <a href=\"https://middleware2020.github.io/ov-chipkaart.html\">OV Chipkaart</a>. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dq48iquf0\">Campus </h2>\n<p><img class=\"post__image--center\" src=\"https://middleware2020.github.io/media/posts/8/campus.jpg\" alt=\"TU Delft Campus\" width=\"679\" height=\"391\"> </p>\n<p>TU Delft's campus is one of the largest in the world and spans 161 hectars. It features the faculty buildings as well as common spaces like the sport facilities <a href=\"https://www.tudelft.nl/en/x/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Delft X</a> and the mixed educational building Pulse. The west side of the campus with the Aula building is directly adjacent to the old town of Delft. A map of the entire campus can be found <a href=\"https://iamap.tudelft.nl/en/accessibility-and-parking/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"align-left\">About 27.000 people travel across our campus every day: students, scientist, visitors, and employees of the university and the companies on campus. Stretching over 161 hectares, the campus is larger than downtown Delft, and one of the largest university campuses in the world. The campus has been equipped with an extensive bicycle and pedestrian road network. The TU Delft campus has a green, parky character. Large parts of the campus are therefore only accessible on foot, by bike or public transport. For motorists there is the campus ring road, which circles the entire campus. Clear signage on the campus ring guides you easily to the central parking lots. From there, every destination is reachable on foot. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>",
