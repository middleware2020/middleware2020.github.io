This card can be charged with funds and used with the contactless readers in any railway station, in buses, trains, trams, and even some ferries. </p>\n<p>When checking in, a lump sum is charged to your card depending on the mode of transportation. At the end of your journey, you need to check out again and then the difference between the lump sum and the effective fare is changed back to your card. For trains, you need a minimum balance of 20€ on your card to check in. For most local public transport around Delft, the lump sum is 4€.

Delft has an extensive network of bike lanes, including some dedicated roads for bicycles. Most public places have a large number of bike racks for parking. Be mindful that bike lanes and cycle paths can be very busy during the peak hours and you should be reasonably experienced when cycling in dense traffic. Information about the most important traffic rules for bicycles can be found on <a href=\"https://www.holland.com/global/tourism/information/general/cycling-rules-in-holland.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">www.holland.com</a>.</p>\n<p>Bikes can be rented from various places in the city.

The bus stop <em>TU Aula</em> is in close proximity to the building. At this moment, it is served by the bus lines 40 and 69 which both depart from the central station. Due to construction work on a new bridge, the buses currently take a detour and take about 20 minutes to reach the TU Campus. From mid 2020, they should run the normal route again and the travel time is reduced to 5 minutes. From end of 2020, the bus line 69 will be replaced by the extended Tram line 19. Line 174 also served the stop and connects with the Metro Line E in Pijnacker Zuid. </p>\n<h5 id=\"mcetoc_1drk661tv0\">Plan your Trip</h5>\n<p>In order to plan your trip, you can use the travel planner <a href=\"https://9292.nl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">9292.nl</a> or the app of the national railway company NS which also contains local public transport information <a href=\"https://www.ns.nl/en/travel-information/ns-on-your-mobile/ns-app.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">www.ns.nl</a></p>\n<h5 id=\"mcetoc_1drk66bom1\">Pay your Fare</h5>\n<p>While it is possible to use one-way disposable tickets at vending stations and, in some forms of transportation, from the driver, you will be charged a surcharge of 1 € per ticket. Consider purchasing an <a href=\"https://middleware2020.github.io/ov-chipkaart.html\">OV Chipkaart</a>. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dq48iquf0\">Campus </h2>\n<p><img class=\"post__image--center\" src=\"https://middleware2020.github.io/media/posts/8/campus.jpg\" alt=\"TU Delft Campus\" width=\"728\" height=\"409\"> </p>\n<p>TU Delft's campus is one of the largest in the world and spans 161 hectars.

The west side of the campus whith the Aula building is directly adjacent to the old town of Delft. A map of the entire campus can be found <a href=\"https://iamap.tudelft.nl/en/accessibility-and-parking/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"align-left\">About 27.000 people travel across our campus every day: students, scientist, visitors, and employees of the university and the companies on campus. Stretching over 161 hectares, the campus is larger than downtown Delft, and one of the largest university campuses in the world. The campus has been equipped with an extensive bicycle and pedestrian road network. The TU Delft campus has a green, parky character. Large parts of the campus are therefore only accessible on foot, by bike or public transport. For motorists there is the campus ring road, which circles the entire campus. Clear signage on the campus ring guides you easily to the central parking lots. From there, every destination is reachable on foot. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>",

The Industrial Track of the Middleware 2020 Conference solicits 6-page papers for presentation during the main conference (single track) and inclusion in the ACM Digital Library. The topics of interest are similar to those in the general conference call for papers. However, the purpose of the Industrial Track is to emphasize the practical issues, observations, and measurements of “real-world” systems and applications and to disseminate information of particular interest to middleware researchers, architects, developers and administrators.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section-title-wrap mr-btm-72\">\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dq414lmf0\" class=\"section-title mr-btm-10\"> </h2>\n<div class=\"section-title-wrap mr-btm-72\">\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dp173ivl0\" class=\"section-title mr-btm-10\">Important Dates</h2>\n<div class=\"entry-content single-entry-post\">\n<table align=\"center\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Paper Submission</strong></td>\n<td><strong>TBD</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Notification</strong></td>\n<td><strong>TBD</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Camera Ready Deadline</strong></td>\n<td><strong>TBD</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section-title-wrap mr-btm-72\">\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dq414lmf1\" class=\"section-title mr-btm-10\">Topics</h2>\n<div class=\"entry-content single-entry-post\">\n<p align=\"left\">The topics of the industry track include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Experience reports and measurements relating to\n<ul>\n<li>Deployments of Internet-scale environments, including grids, datacenters, and other large-scale systems</li>\n<li>Cloud computing middleware, for Infrastructure/Platform/Application as a Service Quality of service, quality of user experience</li>\n<li>Scalability issues (e.g., observed real-life workloads and applications)</li>\n<li>Reliability and availability issues (observed real-life faults, fault models, and recovery mechanisms)</li>\n<li>Security issues (e.g., real attacks on deployed platforms and their impacts)</li>\n<li>Middleware in big data and machine learning systems and applications</li>\n<li>Deployments of embedded systems, sensor networks and Internet of Things</li>\n<li>Deployments of blockchain-based middleware and applications</li>\n<li>AI, accelerators for deep learning, and use cases leveraging it, such as self-driving cars and others</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Approaches, mechanisms and tools for\n<ul>\n<li>Real-life deployment, e.g., hardware equipment management (installation, updates, replacement), management of data center buildings, network points of presence, “data center in-a- box”</li>\n<li>DevOps, continuous software development, integration, and delivery</li>\n<li>Operation and maintenance, e.g., install and upgrade, bug fixes, and backup</li>\n<li>Runtime management, e.g., monitoring, alerting, troubleshooting, and remediation</li>\n<li>Economic, energy-aware, and environmental analyses (e.g. cost and/or energy impacts of various data center deployment models)</li>\n<li>Security management, e.g., intrusion detection, and key management</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section-title-wrap mr-btm-72\">\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dq414lmf2\" class=\"section-title mr-btm-10\">Submission Guidelines</h2>\n<p align=\"left\">A submission must be a single PDF file conforming to the ACM SIGPLAN Conference Format and must not exceed <strong>6 pages</strong> (including abstract, figures, tables, and appendices, but excluding references). Submissions that do not adhere to these guidelines or that violate formatting will be declined without review. Reviewing is <strong>single-blind</strong>; papers must include author names and affiliations. A sample Latex template using the correct ACM SIGPLAN style can be found <a href=\"http://2019.middleware-conference.org/middleware18-sample_latex.zip\">here</a>. Authors are required to add “(industry track)” at the end of their paper title.</p>\n<br>\n<p align=\"left\">Each submission will be reviewed by at least three members of the Industrial Track Program Committee. Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of originality, importance of contribution, technical soundness, evaluation, quality of presentation and appropriate comparison to related work. The committee as a whole will make final decisions about which submissions to accept for presentation at the conference.</p>\n<br>\n<p align=\"left\">Simultaneous submission of the same work to multiple venues, submission of previously published work, or plagiarism constitutes dishonesty or fraud. The conference organizers, like those of other scientific conferences and journals, prohibit these practices and may take actions against authors who have committed them. Papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms will not be considered. If you are uncertain whether your submission meets the guidelines, please contact the program co-chairs.</p>\n<br>\n<p align=\"left\">By submitting a paper, you agree that at least one of the authors will attend the conference and present the paper in person.</p>\n<br>\n<p align=\"left\">Submissions will be handled through HotCRP. Please submit papers to HotCRP. </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
