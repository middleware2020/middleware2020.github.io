In order to plan your trip and get realtime updates, use the travel planner <a href=\"https://9292.nl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">9292.nl</a> or the app of the national railway company NS <a href=\"https://www.ns.nl/en/travel-information/ns-on-your-mobile/ns-app.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">www.ns.nl</a>.</p>\n<h6 id=\"mcetoc_1drk9io871\">RTM</h6>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotterdam_The_Hague_Airport\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rotterdam The Hague Airport</a> is a local airport in the municipality of Rotterdam with a limited number direct international connections including London City, Vienna, Lisbon, and Barcelona. </p>\n<p>The airport is served by the bus line 37 that operates on an irregular service pattern centered around the main plane arrival times and reaches Delft central station in 20 minutes. The bus line 33 connects to Rotterdam central station and the Metro Line E. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1drka27rr2\">By Train</h2>\n<p>The new underground <em>Delft Station</em> is the central train station in Delft and located in close proximity to the historic old town and the TU Campus. Both inter-regional trains (InterCity) and local trains (Sprinter) connect Delft with the main traffic hubs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rotterdam: 10 minutes travel time, up to 10 trains per hour, connections from/to <a href=\"https://www.nsinternational.nl/en/trains/thalys\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Thalys</a> (France and Belgium), <a href=\"https://www.nsinternational.nl/en/trains/eurostar\">Eurostar </a>(England and Belgium), and <a href=\"https://www.nsinternational.nl/en/trains/intercity-brussels\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Intercity Brussels </a>(Belgium)</li>\n<li>Amsterdam Central Station: 45 minutes travel time, direct trains every 30 minutes,  connections from/to <a href=\"https://www.nsinternational.nl/en/trains/ice-international\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ICE International</a> (Germany, Switzerland), <a href=\"https://www.nsinternational.nl/en/trains/intercity-berlin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Intercity Berlin</a> (Germany), and (from Dec. 2020) <a href=\"https://www.nsinternational.nl/en/trains/nighttrain\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ÖBB Nightjet</a> (Germany, Austria)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img class=\"post__image--center\" src=\"https://middleware2020.github.io/media/posts/10/train-2954371_1920.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\"></p>\n<p>In addition, there are direct connections to national traffic hubs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Hague Central Station, 10 minutes travel time, direct trains every 20 minutes. </li>\n<li>Breda, 36 minutes travel time, direct trains every 30 minutes</li>\n<li>Eindhoven, 1:15h travel time, direct trains every 30 minutes </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most major railway stations in the Netherlands, including Delft, are equipped with fare gates. If you travel with an international ticket, you should have a QR code printed on it which needs to be scanned to exit the station. Note that most gates are only equipped with readers for the contactless <a href=\"https://middleware2020.github.io/ov-chipkaart.html\">OV Chipkaart</a> so you need to locate one of the gates which has a barcode scanner (behind a round glass surface, as shown below), such as the wider gates for people traveling with luggage. </p>\n<p><img class=\"post__image--center\" src=\"https://middleware2020.github.io/media/posts/10/fare_gate.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"243\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1drkbb0o73\">By Car</h2>\n<p>Delft is connected to the highways A13 and A4. Parking on the campus is free (as of now). Street parking in the city center is very limited and daily rates start at 12€. Parking garages charge at least 3€ per hour.  </p>\n<p>When driving in the city, be mindful of bicycles which often have the right of way at intersections. </p>",

It offers a variety of different meeting rooms, an auditorium, various facilities, and large exhibition areas. A bar and a buffet restaurant are located on the ground floor. All rooms of the TU Delft Conference Centre are equipped with necessary technology (screen, computer, connectors). Eduroam and conference wifi is available. The building is fully accessible.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dq48u2ef0\">Visitor Address</h2>\n<p id=\"mcetoc_1dq48vc9i1\">TU Delft Aula Conference Centre (Building 20)<br>Mekelweg 5<br>2628 CC Delft<br>The Netherlands</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dq4am6sp1\">Bicyling</h2>\n<p>The bicycle is the traditional mode of transportation in the Netherlands. Delft has an extensive network of bike lanes, including some dedicated roads for bicycles. Most public places have a large number of bike racks for parking. Be mindful that bike lanes and cycle paths can be very busy during the peak hours and you should be reasonably experienced when cycling in dense traffic. Information about the most important traffic rules for bicycles can be found on <a href=\"https://www.holland.com/global/tourism/information/general/cycling-rules-in-holland.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">www.holland.com</a>.</p>\n<p>Bikes can be rented from various places in the city. The orange bikes from Mobike can be unlocked and used through their <a href=\"https://mobike.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">mobile app</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dq4aloo00\">Public Transport</h2>\n<p>The Aula Conference Center can easily be reached with public transport. The bus stop <em>TU Aula</em> is in close proximity to the building. At this moment, it is served by the bus lines 40 and 69 which both depart from the central station. Due to construction work on a new bridge, the buses currently take a detour and take about 20 minutes to reach the TU Campus. From mid 2020, they should run the normal route again and the travel time is reduced to 5 minutes. From end of 2020, the bus line 69 will be replaced by the extended Tram line 19. Line 174 also served the stop and connects with the Metro Line E in Pijnacker Zuid. </p>\n<h5 id=\"mcetoc_1drk661tv0\">Plan your Trip</h5>\n<p>In order to plan your trip, you can use the travel planner <a href=\"https://9292.nl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">9292.nl</a> or the app of the national railway company NS which also contains local public transport information <a href=\"https://www.ns.nl/en/travel-information/ns-on-your-mobile/ns-app.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">www.ns.nl</a></p>\n<h5 id=\"mcetoc_1drk66bom1\">Pay your Fare</h5>\n<p>While it is possible to use one-way disposable tickets at vending stations and, in some forms of transportation, from the driver, you will be charged a surcharge of 1 € per ticket. Consider purchasing an <a href=\"https://middleware2020.github.io/ov-chipkaart.html\">OV Chipkaart</a>. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dq48iquf0\">Campus </h2>\n<p><img class=\"post__image--center\" src=\"https://middleware2020.github.io/media/posts/8/campus.jpg\" alt=\"TU Delft Campus\" width=\"679\" height=\"391\"> </p>\n<p>TU Delft's campus is one of the largest in the world and spans 161 hectars. It features the faculty buildings as well as common spaces like the sport facilities <a href=\"https://www.tudelft.nl/en/x/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Delft X</a> and the mixed educational building Pulse. The west side of the campus with the Aula building is directly adjacent to the old town of Delft. A map of the entire campus can be found <a href=\"https://iamap.tudelft.nl/en/accessibility-and-parking/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"align-left\">About 27.000 people travel across our campus every day: students, scientist, visitors, and employees of the university and the companies on campus. Stretching over 161 hectares, the campus is larger than downtown Delft, and one of the largest university campuses in the world. The campus has been equipped with an extensive bicycle and pedestrian road network. The TU Delft campus has a green, parky character. Large parts of the campus are therefore only accessible on foot, by bike or public transport. For motorists there is the campus ring road, which circles the entire campus. Clear signage on the campus ring guides you easily to the central parking lots. From there, every destination is reachable on foot. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>",
