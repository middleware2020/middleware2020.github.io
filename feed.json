This card can be charged with funds and used with the contactless readers in any railway station, in buses, trains, trams, and even some ferries. </p>\n<p>When checking in, a lump sum is charged to your card depending on the mode of transportation. At the end of your journey, you need to check out again and then the difference between the lump sum and the effective fare is changed back to your card. For trains, you need a minimum balance of 20€ on your card to check in. For most local public transport around Delft, the lump sum is 4€.
